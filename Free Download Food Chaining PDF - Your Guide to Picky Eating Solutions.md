## What is Food Chaining and Why Does it Work?

Food chaining is based on the idea that children are more likely to accept new foods if they are similar to foods they already enjoy. The process involves identifying a "bridge" food that shares characteristics (taste, texture, color) with both the accepted and target food.

**Key Principles of Food Chaining:**

*   **Start with familiar foods:** Identify a food your child already accepts.
*   **Find Similarities:** Look for foods that share similar flavors, textures, or colors.
*   **Gradual Introduction:** Introduce the new food alongside the familiar one.
*   **Patience and Positive Reinforcement:** Avoid pressure and celebrate small victories.
